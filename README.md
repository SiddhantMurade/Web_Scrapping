# Advanced Business Scraper

A robust Python-based web scraping framework designed for collecting and processing business information at scale. This tool is ideal for extracting business details such as name, location, industry, and contact information from platforms like Google Business or LinkedIn. It processes the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing formats. The scraper is scalable and capable of concurrent execution with advanced error handling, logging, and compliance with platform policies.

## Features

- Multi-threaded scraping** with configurable worker count
- Comprehensive logging system** with both file and console output
- Rate limiting and retry mechanisms** to ensure reliability
- User-Agent rotation** for better request distribution
- Automated data processing and cleaning** of scraped data
- Concurrent execution** using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for efficiency
- CSV export functionality** to save the collected data
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms** for robust operation

## Output

The scraper generates two types of output:

1. business_info.csv: Contains all the scraped business data.
2. business_scraper.log: Detailed execution log providing real-time progress and error information.

The scraped data includes the following fields:

- Business Name: The name of the business
- Location: The business's location
- Phone Number: The contact phone number
- Industry: The business's industry
- Email Address: The contact email address
- Name Length: Derived feature, the length of the business name

## Logging

The system provides comprehensive logging with two handlers:

1. File Logging: Saved to `business_scraper.log`
2. Console Logging: Real-time output to `stdout`

Log levels include:
- `DEBUG`: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- `INFO`: General informational messages
- `WARNING`: Potential issues
- `ERROR`: Error messages when things go wrong

## Error Handling

The scraper includes robust error handling mechanisms:

- Automatic Retry: The scraper retries failed requests automatically.
- Comprehensive Exception Logging: Errors are logged for easy debugging.
- Graceful Degradation: The system continues to work with partial results if some data cannot be fetched.
- Thread-safe Operation Handling: Ensures safe concurrent execution.

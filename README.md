# Web_Scrapping
A web scraping tool will collect business data (e.g., name, location, industry) from platforms like Google Business or LinkedIn using APIs or Python libraries. It processes data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing formats. Scalable via async requests, databases, and compliance with platform policies.
